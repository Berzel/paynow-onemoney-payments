# Paynow OneMoney Payments API

Accepting OneMoney payments through paynow should not be a pain for the developer, that is why I created this API. This API attempts to ease out the integration with Paynow so that the developer can focus on the most important parts of the project. The API is very similar to the EcoCash API but I have created them as seperate projects so that you can scale them independently depending on your requirements. If you wish however you can modify each service to accept both payment methods. Enjoy.
